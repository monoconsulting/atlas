<!--
AI INSTRUCTIONS (DO NOT REMOVE)
Purpose: This document is editable by AI/humans. Follow these rules:

1) This is a TEMPLATE. Replace placeholders with project-specific values.
2) "XXXX_" prefix MUST be replaced with the actual PROJECT NAME (kebab_case or snake_case).
3) Ports MUST NOT be assigned until verified against the authoritative Atlas port list.
   See @CHECK_PORTS_API.md for the verification workflow.
4) Do NOT hardcode host ports or secrets in code or docs. Use env vars and .env(.example).
5) Never delete sections. If you deprecate something, strike it through and explain why.
6) Update the CHANGELOG table (versioning in 0.1 steps) whenever content changes.
7) Keep consistency across docs: PORTS, API bases, Endpoints, OpenAPI, Env vars, Security.
-->

> **Template Notice:** This document is a template. You **must** replace all occurrences of `XXXX` with your project name and fill in the placeholders with actual values. Validate ports with Atlas first — see **@CHECK_PORTS_API.md**.

# XXXX — Gateway / Reverse Proxy Rules (Template)

- Route `/api/*` to `core-api:8000` (strip `/api` prefix)
- Route `/engine/*` to `price-engine:8001` (strip `/engine`)
- Static/default → `frontend:80`
- Dev CORS: allow origin `http://127.0.0.1:${FRONTEND_PORT}`
- Log in JSON, include `requestId`

> Implement in Caddy/NGINX/Traefik as appropriate. Keep config files in `ops/gateway/`.


## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Replaced all `XXXX` with the actual project name
- [ ] Ports verified with Atlas (see @CHECK_PORTS_API.md)
- [ ] `.env.example` updated accordingly
- [ ] Cross-referenced with OPENAPI / ENDPOINTS / ENV_VARS
- [ ] Security review: no secrets; headers/policies intact
- [ ] Observability hooks documented (logs/metrics/traces)
